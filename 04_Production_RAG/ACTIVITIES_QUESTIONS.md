# Session 4: Assignment Responses

## Notebook 1: LangGraph RAG Responses

### Question #1: Embedding Dimension
**Answer:** `embedding_dim = 1536`
**Explanation:** OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model produces 1536-dimensional vectors.

### Question #2: Edge Case Handling Extensions

**How to extend our LangGraph implementation to handle edge cases:**

**1. No Relevant Context Scenario:**
- **Add Conditional Node**: Create a context validation node after retrieval to check if results are empty or below relevance threshold
- **Create Fallback Edge**: Route to "insufficient_context" node when no relevant documents found
- **Fallback Response**: Provide helpful "no information found" response with suggestions for query refinement
- **User Guidance**: Suggest alternative search terms or direct users to additional resources

**2. Fact-Checking Requirement:**
- **Add Validation Node**: Insert "fact_checker" node after response generation
- **Confidence Scoring**: Use confidence scores or keyword triggers to determine when fact-checking is needed
- **Loop-back Edge**: Create edge to re-retrieve information if facts are questionable
- **Human Review Node**: Add human-in-the-loop node for high-stakes financial advice responses

**Graph Architecture Extensions:**
```
Query → Retrieve → Validate_Context → [No Context] → Fallback_Response
                 ↓ [Has Context]
                Generate → Fact_Check → [Needs Review] → Human_Review
                         ↓ [Approved]
                        Final_Response
```

**Implementation Benefits:**
- Improved reliability for edge cases
- Better user experience with clear feedback
- Reduced risk for financial advice applications
- Maintainable and extensible architecture

**Enterprise Application**: This approach mirrors enterprise workflow patterns where conditional logic and error handling are essential for production reliability.

## Notebook 2: LangSmith and Evaluation Responses

### Activity #1: LangSmith Trace Screenshot
**LangSmith Tracing Status:** LangSmith tracing was properly configured with all environment variables set correctly, but traces did not appear in the dashboard due to connectivity or API issues.

**Configuration Check Results:**
- LANGSMITH_TRACING: true ✅
- LANGSMITH_API_KEY: Set ✅  
- LANGSMITH_PROJECT: default ✅
- LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2: true ✅
- LANGCHAIN_API_KEY: Set ✅

**Query Execution:** The RAG graph executed successfully and returned detailed information about student loan amounts.

**Expected Trace Components:** Would show query embedding, vector retrieval, context assembly, LLM generation, and response formatting.

### Question #1: Evaluation Results Analysis
**Performance Metrics Observed:**
- Run Count: 69 total evaluations
- Error Rate: 0% - No system failures
- Token Usage: 40,837 total tokens costing $0.36
- Latency: P50: 5.68s, P99: 10.77s

**What These Metrics Express:**
1. **Accuracy Scoring**: Traditional accuracy metrics measuring correctness against ground truth
2. **"Dopeness" Quality Metric**: Custom evaluation for response quality and helpfulness
3. **COT Contextual Accuracy**: Chain-of-thought contextual reasoning assessment

**Key Conclusions:**
- System shows 100% reliability with 0% error rate
- Consistent performance across 69 diverse queries
- Multiple evaluation dimensions provide comprehensive assessment
- Response time (~5.7s median) suitable for complex financial queries

**Production Readiness:** System demonstrates strong reliability and comprehensive evaluation coverage, suitable for production with proper monitoring.
