              "'People failed to pay back their loans primarily due to several interconnected issues highlighted in the complaints:\\n\\n1. **Lack of Clear Information and Communication:** Many borrowers were not adequately informed about when and how their payments were to resume, especially after transferring loan servicers or when loans entered repayment following periods of forbearance or deferment. Several complaints mention not receiving proper notifications about loan start dates, payment due dates, or changes in loan servicers, leading to unintentional delinquencies.\\n\\n2. **Difficulty in Managing Payments and Repayment Plans:** Borrowers reported that available options, such as lowering payments through forbearance or deferment, resulted in accumulating interest, which increased their total debt. Others found it impossible to apply additional payments to principal, feeling that repayment methods were intentionally structured to prolong debt or maximize interest paid.\\n\\n3. **Interest Accumulation and Growing Debt:** The continuation of interest during forbearance or deferment, coupled with lack of transparent breakdowns of the debt and interest, caused balances to increase over time despite payments. This \"snowballing\" effect made it harder for borrowers to pay off their loans.\\n\\n4. **Mismanagement and Transfer of Loans:** Several complaints indicated that loans were transferred between agencies without proper notification, leading to confusion, missed payments, or reporting errors to credit bureaus. For example, loan servicers failed to notify borrowers of buyouts, changes in contact information, or required actions.\\n\\n5. **Inadequate Support and Responsive Failures:** In many cases, loan servicing companies did not provide timely or sufficient responses, re-evaluations, or assistance in preventing delinquency, worsening borrowers\\' ability to manage or correct issues proactively.\\n\\n6. **Misleading or Unclear Policies and Practices:** Some borrowers felt misled or uninformed about their loan obligations, interest calculations, or available repayment options, which contributed to unintentional defaults or delinquency.\\n\\nIn summary, the main reasons for loan repayment failure include inadequate communication from lenders/servicers, structural issues with repayment options that favor interest accrual, mismanagement during transfers, and lack of transparent or responsive support systems. These factors collectively made it difficult for borrowers to keep up with their loan payments, leading to defaults and financial hardships.'"

        "\n",
        "1. Each un-split \"document\" will be designated as a \"parent document\" (You could use larger chunks of document as well, but our data format allows us to consider the overall document as the parent chunk)\n",

        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Okay, maybe that was a few steps - but the basic idea is this:\n",

        "- Search for small documents\n",
        "- Return big documents\n",

Many were steered into long-term forbearances or incorrect payment plans that allowed interest to capitalize and grow, making loans unmanageable over time.\\n\\n2. **Interest and Loan Management Issues:** Accumulating interest, compounded due to improper handling by servicers, led to balances increasing even when payments were made, leaving borrowers unable to pay off the loans within expected timeframes.\\n\\n3. **Servicing Errors and Lack of Communication:** Failures in communication, such as not notifying borrowers of payment resumption, transfer of loans between servicers, or default status, caused confusion and unintentional delinquency. Complaints also mention errors like incorrect reporting to credit bureaus, mishandling of payments, and unauthorized transfer of loans.\\n\\n4. **Inappropriate Steering and Coercion:** Borrowers were often not properly guided toward the most effective repayment plans, such as income-driven repayment or loan forgiveness programs, and were instead pushed into forbearance or consolidation under unfavorable terms that increased their debt.\\n\\n5. **Financial Hardship and Unexpected Circumstances:** Many borrowers experienced financial hardships, unemployment, medical issues, or family crises, which hindered their ability to keep up with payments, especially when compounded by high interest and unfavorable repayment terms.\\n\\n6. **Systemic and Servicing Flaws:** Several complaints point to systemic issues, including poor servicer practices, failure to follow regulations, and mishandling of documentation, all contributing to repayment difficulties.\\n\\nIn summary, the failure to pay back loans was less about irresponsibility and more about systemic servicing issues, lack of clear communication, mismanagement of interest, and inadequate support and guidance for borrowers facing financial hardships.'"
