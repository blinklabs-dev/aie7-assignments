              "'People failed to pay back their loans for several interconnected reasons, including:\\n\\n1. **Accumulating Interest During Forbearance or Deferment**: When borrowers entered forbearance or deferment, interest continued to accrue, increasing the total debt and making it more difficult to pay off. Lowering monthly payments often resulted in interest negating payments made, extending the repayment period and increasing total costs.\\n\\n2. **Unrealistic Payment Options and Lack of Flexibility**: Many borrowers were only offered limited options like forbearance or deferment, which did not reduce the principal significantly. There was often no reevaluation of payment plans based on individual circumstances, leading to financial hardship.\\n\\n3. **Lack of Clear Communication and Notice**: Borrowers frequently did not receive timely or adequate information about when their repayment was resuming, loan transfers, or delinquency status. This lack of notification sometimes resulted in missed payments or credit report issues.\\n\\n4. **High and Increasing Debt Due to Interest and Mismanagement**: Some borrowers experienced their debt growing over time due to high interest rates, mismanaged loans, or transfers between loan servicers without proper notices, leading to confusion and inability to keep up with payments.\\n\\n5. **Economic Hardships and Unforeseen Circumstances**: Many borrowers faced job loss, reduced income, high living costs, or career disruptions, which made it impossible to meet repayment obligations, especially when payments increased or debt grew uncontrollably.\\n\\n6. **Difficulty Applying Payments Properly**: Borrowers reported challenges in applying extra funds toward principal or paying off smaller loans, with payments often directed toward interest, prolonging debt and impeding rapid repayment.\\n\\n7. **Lack of Transparency and Trust Issues**: Poor communication about loan status, interest calculations, and transfer procedures created confusion and mistrust, affecting borrowers’ ability to manage their debts effectively.\\n\\nIn summary, a combination of interest accrual during hardship periods, lack of flexible and transparent repayment options, communication failures, economic difficulties, and loan mismanagement contributed to many borrowers’ inability to repay their loans.'"

        "- **Perspective diversification** - Each reformulation approaches the topic from different angles, surfacing documents with varied language\n",
        "- **Semantic coverage** - Multiple queries cast a wider semantic net, reducing the chance of missing relevant content due to exact wording differences\n",

        "1. Each un-split \"document\" will be designated as a \"parent document\" (You could use larger chunks of document as well, but our data format allows us to consider the overall document as the parent chunk)\n",
        "2. Store those \"parent documents\" in a memory store (not a VectorStore)\n",
        "3. We will chunk each of those documents into smaller documents, and associate them with their respective parents, and store those in a VectorStore. We'll call those \"child chunks\".\n",
        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",

        "- **Over-splitting** - Each similar FAQ question might be treated as a separate chunk despite being topically related\n",

        "- **Loss of context** - Related Q&A pairs might be separated when they should stay together\n",

        "**Algorithm adjustments:**\n",
        "- **Increase similarity threshold** - Use a higher cosine similarity cutoff to group more similar sentences together\n",
