# Session 13: My Journey Building Custom AI Tools with MCP

## What I Built - Four AI-Powered Research Tools

When I started this assignment, I had no idea how powerful MCP (Model Context Protocol) could be. I ended up creating what feels like my own personal AI research assistant that lives right inside Cursor. Here's what I built:

### 1. The GitHub Repository Detective üîç
**What it does**: This tool has become my go-to for evaluating any GitHub repository. Instead of manually clicking through tabs and trying to figure out if a project is worth my time, I just paste the URL and get a comprehensive health report.

**Why I love it**: It gives me a "health score" out of 100 based on stars, activity, licensing, and community engagement. No more guessing if a project is abandoned or thriving! During my demo, I analyzed Microsoft's VS Code repository and was amazed to see all the metrics laid out so clearly.

**Real impact**: This has already changed how I evaluate potential dependencies for projects. I'm making data-driven decisions instead of going with gut feelings.

### 2. The AI Trend Hunter üìä
**What it does**: Ever wondered what's trending in AI right now? This tool searches GitHub for hot AI repositories based on any topic I'm curious about. I can filter by programming language and minimum stars.

**My favorite discovery**: While testing it, I searched for "video processing AI" repositories and found some incredible projects I never would have discovered otherwise. It's like having a personal scout for cutting-edge AI projects.

**Game changer moment**: Instead of spending hours scrolling through GitHub or Reddit trying to find cool AI projects, I can now get curated lists in seconds.

### 3. The Real-Time Knowledge Bridge üåê
**What it does**: Since Claude's training data has a cutoff, this tool gives me access to the latest information happening right now through web search.

**Why it matters**: When I'm researching AI trends or need current information, this bridges the gap between Claude's knowledge and what's happening today. It's like giving Claude internet access.

**Practical use**: During development, I could search for the latest AI news and get immediate results without leaving my conversation with Claude.

### 4. The Fun Factor (Dice Roller) üé≤
**What it does**: Okay, this one's just for fun, but it demonstrates something important - MCP tools don't have to be all business!

**The deeper lesson**: Adding this showed me that AI tools can be engaging and interactive, not just utilitarian. Sometimes a little whimsy makes the whole experience more enjoyable.

## My Technical Journey

### The Learning Curve
I'll be honest - setting up my first MCP server was intimidating at first. Working with FastMCP, managing Python environments, and getting all the APIs to play nicely together took some patience. But once it clicked, I felt like I had superpowers.

### What Went Right
The biggest win was realizing I didn't need complex authentication to create something useful. The GitHub public API gives you 60 requests per hour, which is perfect for research purposes. I focused on building something that just works, rather than getting bogged down in enterprise-level complexity.

### Code Philosophy I Developed
Every tool I built follows what I'm calling the "graceful failure" principle - if something goes wrong (bad URL, network issue, API limit), the user gets a helpful message instead of a cryptic error. This made the tools feel professional and polished.

### The Stack That Worked
- **FastMCP**: Way simpler than I expected - made MCP development actually enjoyable
- **Python 3.12.2**: Solid, reliable, with great error handling capabilities  
- **GitHub + Tavily APIs**: Powerful data sources that complement each other perfectly
- **Virtual environment with uv**: Clean dependency management that just works

## My Demo Experience
**Loom URL**: https://www.loom.com/share/b270b1cbe0c44e1d8decf9c2da4a50ec?sid=c4825202-d25e-49c7-b3c7-6834ae125f46

Recording that demo was honestly nerve-wracking at first, but then it became exciting as I realized how smoothly everything worked! Watching all four tools perform flawlessly in real-time was incredibly satisfying. There's something magical about asking Claude to analyze a repository and getting back a comprehensive report in seconds.

The moment that stood out most was when I analyzed the VS Code repository and saw the health score of 100/100 - it really drove home how this tool can quickly identify high-quality projects worth learning from.

## Three Big Lessons I Learned (The Real Stuff)

### 1. MCP is Like Giving Your AI Assistant Superpowers ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Before this project, I thought of AI assistants as being limited to their training data and basic responses. MCP completely changes the game. Now Claude can actively research GitHub repositories, search the web, and perform specialized analyses. It's like the difference between having a knowledgeable friend and having that same friend with access to a research library and the internet.

**Personal impact**: I now see AI not as a static tool, but as a platform I can extend with custom capabilities. This shift in thinking has already changed how I approach problem-solving.

### 2. Good APIs + Smart Processing = Magic ‚ú®
I used to think APIs were just data sources, but this project taught me that the real value comes from intelligently processing and presenting that data. The GitHub API gives you raw numbers, but transforming those into a health score with contextual analysis creates genuine insight.

**The breakthrough moment**: When I first saw my health scoring algorithm rate repositories and realized it was making better assessments than my manual evaluations, I understood the power of data-driven decision making.

### 3. Developer Tools Should Feel Delightful, Not Just Functional üéØ
Adding personality to my tools (emojis, conversational language, even a fun dice roller) made the whole experience more engaging. I learned that developer experience isn't just about functionality - it's about creating tools that people actually enjoy using.

**What surprised me**: The dice roller, which I almost didn't include, ended up being a perfect demonstration of MCP's versatility and made the demo more memorable.

## Three Things I'm Still Figuring Out (The Honest Truth)

### 1. How Do You Scale This Thing? ü§î
Right now my MCP server works great for me personally, but I have no idea how to build this for thousands of users. How do you handle authentication, rate limiting, and keeping costs under control? The production architecture side is still a mystery.

**What keeps me up at night**: Imagining trying to serve 1000+ developers simultaneously with this setup and realizing I'd need to completely rethink the architecture.

### 2. Making AI Tools That Don't Break üõ†Ô∏è
My tools handle errors reasonably well, but I know there are edge cases I haven't thought of. How do you build AI tools that are truly bulletproof? What happens when APIs change, or when users find creative ways to break things?

**Current anxiety**: Every time someone else uses my tools, I wonder what unexpected error message they'll encounter that I never considered.

### 3. Creating AI Tools That Work Together Seamlessly üîó
I built four separate tools, but I can already imagine scenarios where they should work together automatically. Like: find trending repos ‚Üí analyze the top 3 ‚Üí search for related news articles ‚Üí generate a summary report. But I don't know how to architect that kind of intelligent workflow yet.

**The vision I can't quite reach**: Tools that anticipate what you need next and proactively provide it, rather than waiting for individual commands.

## What This Means for My Career (Getting Real)

### The Skills I Actually Gained
This wasn't just a coding exercise - I learned how to:
- **Design user experiences** that feel natural and helpful
- **Integrate multiple APIs** to create something greater than the sum of its parts  
- **Think about data presentation** that informs decisions rather than just displaying numbers
- **Build tools that solve real problems** I actually face as a developer

### Where I Could Take This
The business potential here is genuinely exciting. There's clearly demand for better developer research tools, and I've proven I can build something that works. The path from "cool personal project" to "SaaS product that helps thousands of developers" feels surprisingly clear.

**The opportunity I see**: Most developers still do repository research manually. A polished version of these tools could save teams hundreds of hours and help them make better technology choices.

### My Confidence Boost
Six months ago, I would have been intimidated by the idea of building custom AI tools. Now I feel like I can extend AI capabilities to solve almost any problem I encounter. That mental shift is probably the most valuable outcome of this project.

## What This Means Going Forward

This project genuinely changed how I think about AI tools. Instead of seeing Claude as a smart chatbot, I now see it as a platform I can extend with custom capabilities. The tools I built are already part of my daily workflow - I use the GitHub analyzer almost every time I'm evaluating a new library or project.

**The bigger realization**: MCP opens up possibilities I hadn't considered before. Every repetitive research task I do could potentially become a custom AI tool. That's a pretty exciting way to think about productivity.

**Next steps**: I'm already brainstorming other tools - maybe something for analyzing code quality across repositories, or a tool that tracks technology trends over time. The foundation is there, and now it's about finding more problems worth solving.

## Final Thoughts

This assignment started as a requirement but became something I genuinely use and value. I built tools that solve real problems I face as a developer, learned skills that feel immediately applicable, and gained confidence in extending AI capabilities.

The most surprising part? How natural it feels to have Claude use these custom tools. It's like the difference between having a research assistant and having one with access to specialized databases and analysis capabilities.

**Status**: Complete, functional, and already integrated into my daily workflow. üöÄ
